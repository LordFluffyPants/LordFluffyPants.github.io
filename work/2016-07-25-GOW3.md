NOTES
the quick time evets tell you what button to hit without having to look for the prompt (screen white on direction)
very cenimatic, camera angles could still use some work
Bosses can get pretty difficult at the end, but still do-able
health upgrades are few and far in between (others like item and magic are way more common)
