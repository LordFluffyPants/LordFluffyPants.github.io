Hey guys and welcome to BOE reviews where we review games old and new, I'm Jake Hayhurst and today we are reviewing Guilty Gear XRD -SIGN-. XRD is the newest entry in the franchise of fighting games from Arc Systems. This title was originally released on the PS4 and it wasnt until recently it was released on the PC. The PC version comes at a significantly reduced price as well as all the DLC characters included free of charge. I have been a long fan of the guilty gear games ever since I played X2 on the PS2 and remember sinking hours into the nintendo DS spin off game Guilty Gear Dust Strikers. Guilty Gear is a beloved franchise that many arc system fans know and love from the iconic sound track to the interesting cast of characters. Before XRD the last installment of Guilty Gear franchise was Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R which was still played competitively. So lets take a look and see if XRD is able to compete with the Guilty Gear legacy.
