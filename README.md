  - Posts should have the post_author: tag also defined for the author's name to appear.
  - All posts should have a header / leading image related to the game
  - All posts should have a section at the end linking the reader to store pages for the game
    - The store pages should include where applicable

## Criteria for Reviews
### BoE Reviews will never tell you how to go about reviewing video games, but we do have guidelines for writing on this website to keep journalistic integrity.

  - Be open about EVERYTHING
    - Give reasons about criticism of game being reviewed
    - Disclose if you have received a review copy
    - Disclose biases you might have for a certain genre or series
  - NEVER take money to review a game  
  - Avoid derogatory language
    - Racial slurs, sexism, xenophobic language will not be excepted
  - Do not overuse "curse" words
