I am LordFluffyPants and I have been playing video games since I was five years old. I am currently studying computer science at [Christopher Newport University](http://cnu.edu) and wish to be involved in creating games using what I have learned. One of my personal philosophies is transparency. Thus as such if I receive a review copy of a game, receive the game as a gift, or buy the game when it is on sale then that information will be disclosed on the review.

###Review Criteria 
My goal when reviewing games is to convey how fun the game is to me and if I would recommend this at full asking price at time of review. To do this I will go over in every review:

+ Story
+ Style 
+ Mechanics
+ My gameplay experience
