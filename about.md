title: About The Reviewers
---

Here at BOE Reviews we pride ourselves on a long history of playing games. With a backgrounds and interests in computers, games, and gamer culture we aim to further the medium by giving fair and honest reviews. Most of the reviews here, while aiming to be objective as possible, have subjective content within them (By which we mean that most if not all our reviews are the Best Opinions Ever). Better understanding the reviewer of the game will greatly help to make an educated decision of whether or not you should buy these games. It will also help you to find different viewpoints and open the door for newer gaming experiences.

### Jake Hayhurst
Hello my name is Jake and I have been playing video games since I was five years old. I am currently getting my masters in computer science. I tend to like a wide variety of games, but my favorite genres are strategy and fighting games. I also tend to gravitate with appreciating a game more if it has a really good story, but also realize that gameplay comes before story.

### TK Stamm
I'm Tk, I play games.  Many games, for unhealthy periods of time.  Then I spout opinions about them with friends, and some of the more cohesive stuff ends up here.  I play an odd assortment of stuff, but mostly obsess about more challenge-oriented stuff such as the Souls series and high end raiding.

Nick is a close friend and will write commentary or reviews from time to time.
