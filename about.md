title: About The Reviewers
---

Here at BOE Reviews we pride ourselves on a long history of playing games. With a backgrounds and interests in computers, games, and gamer culture we aim to further the medium by giving fair and honest reviews. Most of the reviews here, while aiming to be objective as possible, have subjective content within them. Better understanding the reviewer of the game will greatly help to make an educated decision of whether or not you should buy these games. It will also help you to find different viewpoints and open the door for newer gaming experiences.

###Jake Hayhurst
Hello my name is Jake and I have been playing video games since I was five years old. I am currently studying computer science at [Christopher Newport University](http://cnu.edu) and wish to be involved in creating games using what I have learned. Some of my favorite game genres are: strategy, 4x, fighting, moba, ARPG, and MMO. To see the games that I am currently playing check out my [Steam profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/LFP/).

####Review Criteria 
My goal when reviewing games is to convey how fun the game is to me. I pick games that I feel stongly about, weither it be in a positive light or a negative one. I plan to go over my gameplay experiences, story, ascetics, and mechanics if they are relevent to the gameplay. 

###TK Stamm
I'm Tk, I play games.  Many games, for unhealthy periods of time.  Then I spout opinions about them with friends, and some of the more cohesive stuff ends up here.  I play an odd assortment of stuff, but mostly obsess about more challenge-oriented stuff such as the Souls series and high end raiding. Check out my [Steam profile](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033602993/).

####Review Criteria
I tend to review games I feel strongly one way or another about, try to pick apart the successful or unsuccessful elements, and end with some kind of recommendation. In general though, I'll try to cover pacing, story, addictiveness, core gameplay, soundtrack, and overall aesthetic if it's relevant.  There's no real cohesive time period or style to the games, just the whims of a drunken madman.
