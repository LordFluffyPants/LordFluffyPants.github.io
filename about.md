Here at fluffy game reviews we pride ourselves on a long history of playing games. With a backgrounds and interests in computers, games, and gamer culture we aim to further the medium by giving fair and honest reviews. Most of the reviews here, while aiming to be objective as possible, have subjective content within them. Better understanding the reviewer of the game will greatly help to make an educated decision of whether or not you should buy this game. It will also help you to find different viewpoints and open the door for newer gamming experiences.

One important thing to note is that fluffy gaming will have 100% transparency with our reviews. We will disclose in our reviews how much we paid for a game, if we got the game as a gift, and if we get a review copy of the game

###Jake Hayhurst
Hello my name is Jake and I have been playing video games since I was five years old. I am currently studying computer science at [Christopher Newport University](http://cnu.edu) and wish to be involved in creating games using what I have learned. Some of my favorite game genres are 4x (and strategy), fighting, Mobas, and shooter games. To see the games that I am currently playing check out my [Steam profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/LFP/).

####Review Criteria 
My goal when reviewing games is to convey how fun the game is to me and if I would recommend this at full asking price at time of review. To do this I will go over in every review:

+ Story
+ Style 
+ Mechanics
+ My gameplay experience
