A Hat in Time started back as a concept on kickstarter back in 2013 to revive the 3D collect-a-thon platformer. This would spawn others to follow suit and attempt to revive the collect-a-thon genre. The most notable is the Yooka-Laylee kickstarter made by ex Rare developers and had a significantly bigger budget. Both A Hat in Time and Yooka-Laylee launched in 2017 with Yooka-Laylee launching in April and A Hat in Time in October. Yooka-Laylee launched with positive reviews and some harsh criticisms from vocal fans. One of the most notable criticisms stemmed from the lack of innovation from the game and was accused of being "nostalgia bait" and not bringing the genre into the modern era of gamming. A Hat in Time however seems to address these criticisms and bring the genre into the modern era of gaming while also being cute as heck.

One of the first complements I have to give the game is that it is cute as heck. In A Hat in Time the main character is a small alien girl that somehow, dispite being an alien , looks exactly like a small human child. Not only is the main character (called hat girl) cute but also the environment and situations you find your character in just ooze cuteness. One of my favorite chapters in this game is when you help two different birds during a movie competition by being the star of their films. This chapter is fun and the way hat girl interacts with characters and other small voice clips in the game make this game not only really fun but also cute as heck.

Of course this game couldn't stand on its own just by being cute. <!-- Talk about the gameplay here -->
