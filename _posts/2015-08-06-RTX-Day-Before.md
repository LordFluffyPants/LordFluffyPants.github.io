It's been a year since myself, Nick, and TK went to RTX. Last Years RTX was a bit of a disaster when it came to attending panels and getting autographs last year. Panels you generally had to line up 1 to 2 hours before the panel started if you even wanted a chance to get into the pannel. Autographs were even handled more poorly gather in a mass of people and hope you get selected to wait in a line for another hour. Not to mention how confusing when they would select times to pull people out of a massive crowd.

This year seems to be a lot better in terms of how things are handled. With your RTX ticket aside from all the other goodies you get a ticket to get an autograph from one of the panels. While not a lot of people are happy about this it's definitely better than the shit fest that was last year. When it comes to panel attendance I cannot speak as the convention starts tomorrow but most of the panels are in the various hotels next to the Austin Convention Center.

Other than ragging at how things were handled last year, this year things are looking better. One thing new from last year is the inclusion of a concert on Saturday night 20:00 - 00:00. A lot of returning sponsors and exhibitors are back and a lot of new ones. We plan to go around and talk to all the indie devs showcasing their games so expect to see some impressions from myself, TK, and Nick. Also expect to see a wrap of of our days at RTX.
